Welcome to your hands-on experience with AI Agents! In this exercise, you'll take your first step into the world of autonomous AI systems by building a simple AI Agent from scratch. This is your gateway to creating adaptable, role-based AI applications that can interact dynamically with users and automate complex workflows. Whether you're looking to enhance customer interactions, create virtual assistants, or build AI-driven solutions, this exercise will give you the foundational skills you need to start.


## Scenario
Imagine you're part of an AI development team at a company specializing in virtual assistants. Your team is responsible for developing AI-powered agents that can interact with users in different contexts, such as customer support, business consulting, and creative content generation. To achieve this, you need to design an Agent class that provides a structured way to interact with an LLM.

By the end of this task, you'll understand how to define AI agent roles and instructions, manage LLM interactions, and build an abstraction that allows greater control over AI responses.

## Challenge
In this exercise, you are tasked with creating an abstraction on top of LLMs, making them more adaptable and efficient for various use cases.

You need to build an Agent class that:

- Can be initialized with a custom role, instructions, and model parameters.
- Sends user input to an LLM API and processes the response.
- Ensures that the LLM follows predefined roles and behaviors.

## Steps

1. Setup Your Environment
2. Define the Agent Class
3. Create Agents with Different Roles
4. Experiment and Refine
