Welcome to the next evolution of AI Agents! In this exercise, you'll enhance your AI agent by adding tool-calling capabilities, allowing it to interact with external functions dynamically.

By equipping your agent with the ability to invoke external tools when needed, you unlock a new level of interactivity. Your AI can now fetch real-time data, run calculations, and interact with the outside world, making it much more powerful.

## Scenario
Imagine you're building an AI-powered assistant that helps users with various tasks such as:

- Fetching real-time stock prices
- Performing complex calculations
- Querying a weather API
- Searching a database

Instead of manually deciding when to call which function, your AI agent will automatically detect when a tool is needed and invoke it.

## Challenge
Your task is to:

- Create a Tool class that acts as an abstraction for external functions.
- Modify the Agent class to support dynamic tool calling.
- Enable the AI agent to decide when it needs to use a tool.

At the end of this exercise, you'll have a working AI agent that can use external tools on its own!

## Steps

1. Setup your Environment
2. Create the Tool Class
3. Update the Agent Class
4. Build and Test Tool-Calling Agents
5. Experiment and Refine
