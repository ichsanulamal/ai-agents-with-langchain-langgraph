Welcome to your next challenge in mastering LangChainâ€™s Language Chain Expression Language (LCEL)! ðŸŽ¯

In this exercise, youâ€™ll build a multi-step workflow using LCEL to solve a more complex task than simply generating a joke. Weâ€™ll walk through the entire process, from planning a task, to using multiple prompts and chaining steps together.

By the end of this exercise, youâ€™ll have built a workflow that generates a business idea, analyzes it, and presents the results in a structured, easy-to-understand format.
